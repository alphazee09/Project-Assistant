## Configuration

You can adjust the following parameters in the script:
- `project_path`: Specifies the path to the project or codebase.

## Note

- The script assumes that you have the necessary tools and libraries installed and properly configured.
- It's important to run the script in the appropriate directory where the project or codebase is located.
- The script uses command-line interfaces for the tools and libraries used (`pip`, `sonar-scanner`, `dependency-check`, `zap-cli`, `radon`).
